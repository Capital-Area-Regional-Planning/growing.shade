# Report for ```r reportfor```.

This report might be super cool eventually!

## Status of the tree canopy



Based on the ``r params$vars_used``` preset used, the selected area ranks. 

Understand how the tree canopy of the selected region compares to other geographies across the region.

```{r status, echo=F, message=F, warning=F}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = cyl)) +
  geom_point()
```

## Equity analysis

Understand how people and trees interact, and where the selected geography compares.

## Trees past and present (with lessons for the future)

Something about tree community composition.
