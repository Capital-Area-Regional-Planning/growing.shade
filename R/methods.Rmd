## Priority variables

Priority variables with the exclusion of 'average greenness' were sourced from the 'Equity Considerations Dataset' published by the Met Council. Data is given at the Census tract level. More information about those variables can be found on the  (<a href="https://gisdata.mn.gov/dataset/us-mn-state-metc-society-equity-considerations" target="_blank">Minnesota Geospatial Commons</a>). 
<br><br>
Census tract average greenness was calculated from Sentinel-2 satellite data processed on Google Earth Engine. Briefly, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was used as a measure of greenness. A composite image of the year 2020 was made where each pixel contained the maximum NDVI observed within the calendar year. Sentinel-2 collects measurements approximately 2-3 times a week, with a pixel resolution of 10 meters x 10 meters. Then, the tract-average NDVI value from this 'maximum NDVI' composite image was taken. NDVI over water bodies (rivers or lakes) was not included.

Based on user-defined selection of priority variables, the data are scaled and standardized in order to create a single, integrated priority value. Download the pdf below for more information on that.

## Priority areas

Detailed priority areas where tree planting could be suitable were obtained using NDVI calculated from Sentinel-2 satellite data with all processing done using Google Earth Engine. First, we removed all pixels identified as having tree canopy in 2020 or classified as having a land use of either water, highways, railroads, airports, or agricultural crops in 2016 (see below). Then we created a composite image of the year 2020 where each pixel contained the maximum NDVI observed within the calendar year. Land use in 2016 was assigned to each pixel for mapping purposes.

### Identifying tree canopy in 2020

Plant phenological patterns were leveraged in order to identify tree canopy gaps rather than identify gaps in overall 'greenness.' Five distinct phenological time periods were used. For each time period, a composite image was made showing the maximum NDVI observed. Then different thresholds of NDVI were used to separate trees from grasses and crops.

- Winter (1 January 2020 - 15 March 2020): pixel classified as a conifer tree if winter NDVI is above 0.3 (identify trees which are green in the winter) OR
- Spring (15 March 2020 - 30 April 2020): pixel classified as a deciduous tree if spring NDVI is less than 0.5 (remove cool season grass) AND
- Early summer (1 May 2020 - 15 June 2020): early summer NDVI is greater than 0.55 (remove warm season crops) AND
- Summer (1 July 2020 - 15 September 2020): summer NDVI is greater than 0.55 (identify trees which are are green in the summer) AND
- Fall (15 September 2020 - 30 October 2020): fall NDVI is greater than 0.4 (remove early senescing crops)

### Identifying land use in 2016

If useful, this data should be updated to have 2020 data. Info from Paul.... Certain areas not elligible for tree planting. Did not remove building footprints, because in many cases trees could shade buildings, or they could have green roofs, or other ideas. Removed highways but not roads because tree canopy can also extend over roads. Same with parking lots. **BUT...this probably could be removed if we wanted (I think removing roads would be much easier than removing building footprints).** https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_metc/plan_generl_lnduse2016/metadata/metadata.html
