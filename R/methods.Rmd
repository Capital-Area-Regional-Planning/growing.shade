## External resources

<br>
Managing the tree canopy is a complex and important subject. Growing Shade is a unique tool offering users the ability to customize prioritization and see detailed maps of tree canopy gaps. It is under active development, so please check back or contact us for more details. However there are other tools which may be useful, and it should be noted that there are still many unanswered questions. The list below has been compiled as a starting point.

<br>
Finally, our experience and research tells us that data cannot substitute for engagement with prioritized stakeholders to understand community-specific concerns or opportunities. The on-the-ground knowledge of residents and the expertise of practitioners are valuable sources of information necessary to enhance and refine the shared understanding of this data.

## Methods

<br>

### Identifying tree canopy

Detailed priority areas where tree planting could be suitable were obtained using NDVI calculated from Sentinel-2 satellite data with all processing done using Google Earth Engine. First, we removed all pixels identified as having tree canopy in 2020 or classified as having a land use of either water, highways, railroads, airports, or agricultural crops in 2016 (see below). Then we created a composite image of the year 2020 where each pixel contained the maximum NDVI observed within the calendar year. Land use in 2016 was assigned to each pixel for mapping purposes.

<br>
Plant phenological patterns were leveraged in order to identify tree canopy gaps rather than identify gaps in overall 'greenness.' Five distinct phenological time periods were used. For each time period, a composite image was made showing the maximum NDVI observed. Then different thresholds of NDVI were used to separate trees from grasses and crops. All areas that were classified as water or cultivated cropland were removed. Finally, we then divided our calculated tree canopy by 2. This scaling factor is appropriate for our methods of using 10 m x 10 m resolution data, which is often much larger than tree canopies. This scaling factor makes our data align very closely with other reports while still leveraging the scalability and temporal accuracy of our method. 
<br>

- Winter (1 January 2020 - 15 March 2020): pixel classified as a conifer tree if winter NDVI is above 0.3 (identify trees which are green in the winter) OR
- Spring (15 March 2020 - 30 April 2020): pixel classified as a deciduous tree if spring NDVI is less than 0.5 (remove cool season grass) AND
- Early summer (1 May 2020 - 15 June 2020): early summer NDVI is greater than 0.55 (remove warm season crops) AND
- Summer (1 July 2020 - 15 September 2020): summer NDVI is greater than 0.55 (identify trees which are are green in the summer) AND
- Fall (15 September 2020 - 30 October 2020): fall NDVI is greater than 0.4 (remove early senescing crops)

<br>

### Priority variables

Priority variables with the exclusion of 'average greenness' were sourced from the 'Equity Considerations Dataset' published by the Met Council. Data is given at the Census tract level. More information about those variables can be found on the  (<a href="https://gisdata.mn.gov/dataset/us-mn-state-metc-society-equity-considerations" target="_blank">Minnesota Geospatial Commons</a>). 
<br><br>
Census tract average greenness was calculated from Sentinel-2 satellite data processed on Google Earth Engine. Briefly, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was used as a measure of greenness. A composite image of the year 2020 was made where each pixel contained the maximum NDVI observed within the calendar year. Sentinel-2 collects measurements approximately 2-3 times a week, with a pixel resolution of 10 meters x 10 meters. Then, the tract-average NDVI value from this 'maximum NDVI' composite image was taken. NDVI over water bodies (rivers or lakes) was not included nor was NDVI over cultivated fields. 
<br><br>
Based on user-defined selection of priority variables, the data are scaled and standardized in order to create a single, integrated priority value. Download the pdf below for more information on that.
