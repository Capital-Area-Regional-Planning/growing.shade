# Where to plant trees

<br>
This tool aggregates data to help facilitate discussions and identify priority areas to enhance our regionâ€™s tree canopy. See the Methods tab for more information.

<br>
While the tool is fully customizable, regional priority layers have been identified for three key presets including:

- **Climate change**: This preset considers variables about the natural environment (existing tree canopy), and the intersection of the natural and built environments (proportion of developed acres in primary flood zone, average land surface temperature on a hot day). <br>
- **Environmental justice**: This preset considers demographics historically excluded from and disproportionately affected by environmental decision makers (proportion of non-White residents, share of households with annual income less than $35,000), and variables about the intersection of the natural and built environments (proportion of developed acres in primary flood zone, average land surface temperature on a hot day, existing tree canopy).<br>
- **Public health**: This preset considers demographics which are vulnerable to heat-related illness (proportion of residents less than 18 or greater than 64 years old), health-related risks which can be mitigated by trees (lifetime cancer risk from inhalation of air toxins, average land surface temperature on a hot day), and  characteristics about the existing tree canopy (existing tree canopy).
