Please refer to the <a href="www/Growing Shade User Guide (November 2021).pdf" target="_blank">text user guide</a> or the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Qbhaq4gWs" target="_blank">video user guide</a> for help using the tool. Short answers to frequently asked questions can be found below.

**Q. How are the priority layers created?**
<span style='line-height: .1;'><br></span>
A. Priority scores are calculated using equally-weighted variables.

**Q. How did you choose the variables for the priority layers?**
<span style='line-height: .1;'><br></span>
A. Presets are developed to provide starting points for various stakeholder groups. 

**Q. How can I isolate individual variables? Can I visualize the patterns for a single variable?**
<span style='line-height: .1;'><br></span>
A. Click on the "Custom" priority layer, then select a single variable. 

**Q. I'm interested in understanding how the tree canopy intersects with a specific racial or ethnic group rather than all communities of color.**
<span style='line-height: .1;'><br></span>
A. Raw data can be downloaded from within the "mapping tool" tab if you wish explore relationships not shown in the report.

**Q. Why do different canopy tools show different canopy coverage percents?**
<span style='line-height: .1;'><br></span>
A. We created this tool to respond to the stakeholder need of providing up-to-date, actionable data. Therefore, we focus on satellite data to provide current data that can be used in decision-making. Current data is necessary to manage impacts from invasive species like emerald ash borer or respond to emerging climate hazards.

The trade-off for using the most current data is that the spatial resolution is lower. Imagery obtained from the Sentinel-2 satellite has a spatial resolution of 10 meters x 10 meters, which can be larger than the canopy from a single tree. The tree canopy as identified with Sentinel-2 data has been calibrated to account for this lower spatial resolution. If users prefer higher spatial resolution and do not require temporally updated data, the <a href = "https://gisdata.mn.gov/dataset/base-landcover-twincities" target = "_blank">Twin Cities Metropolitan area 1-meter land cover classification</a> may be useful. More information is given with the "methods" tab. 

**Q. Why do different canopy tools show different priority areas?**
<span style='line-height: .1;'><br></span>
A. There several tools, like the <a href = "https://www.americanforests.org/our-work/tree-equity-score/" target = "_blank">American Forestsâ€™ Tree Equity Score</a>, that are worth exploring. The Growing Shade Project was created to specifically address to the unique challenges and opportunities of our region, reflecting priorities that may not be so readily detailed in a national, more generalized tool. Growing Shade responds to the specific climate change, conservation, environmental justice, and public health issues in our region. Also, users can customize our tool to address their individualized needs, which can be highly specific (for instance, a user may want to focus on planting trees in areas to enhance health benefits in children).  

**Q. Why doesn't the tool show trees where there are trees? Why does the tool show trees where there are not trees?**
<span style='line-height: .1;'><br></span>
A. Calibration revealed that the tree layer mapped in Growing Shade identifies areas which have at least 50% tree canopy cover. The tree canopy has been identified from satellite imagery using a machine learning method rather than collecting on-the-ground data. More information is given with the "methods" tab.
