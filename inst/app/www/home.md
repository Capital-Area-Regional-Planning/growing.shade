<p class="home"> <b>Access to trees is a human right.</b> Everyone deserves the cool shade, clean air, better runoff management, and public health 
<a href="https://daneclimateaction.org/Initiatives/Tree-Canopy#ImportanceofCanopy">benefits that trees provide</a>. 
Enhancing and preserving tree canopy cover is an important step to creating a healthy and resilient county. </p>
<br>
<p class="home"> 
Growing Shade was developed for residents, community groups, planners, and foresters. 
Stakeholder engagement remains essential to understanding community-specific concerns and opportunities for enhancing, preserving, and maintaining the tree canopy. 
Growing Shade combines demographic, environmental, public health, and socioeconomic data. 
Here are a few ways you can use the mapping tool. </p>

<h2><b> The Tree Canopy Collaborative </b></h2>
<p class="home">
	The Growing Shade website is maintained by the <a href="https://daneclimateaction.org/Initiatives/Tree-Canopy" target="_blank">
	Tree Canopy Collaborative</a>, as an initiative of the Dane County Office of Energy and Climate Change. 
	The aim of the Tree Canopy Collaborative is to collectively maintain, protect, and expand 
	public and private tree canopy across Dane County, with a particular focus is on ensuring 
	equitable access to trees and their associated benefits for all residents. 
	<br>
	<br>
	Growing Shade was originally developed out of a collaboration between the
	<a href="https://metrocouncil.org/" target="_blank">Metropolitan
	Council</a>,
	<a href="https://www.nature.org/en-us/about-us/where-we-work/united-states/minnesota/" target="_blank">The
	Nature Conservancy</a>, and
	<a href="https://treetrust.org/" target="_blank">Tree Trust</a> for mapping canopy in the Twin Cities region.

Click the panels below to read about a few different use cases.

<div class="accordion center">Teacher</div>
<div class="panel">
	<br>
	<p class="home">
	Ani teaches the third grade. As part of an environmental unit, she sends her students outside to see how many different kinds of trees they can find. 
	Unfortunately, her class discovers that there are only a few trees surrounding their school.
	</p>
	<br>

	<br>
	<br>
	<p class="home">
	Her class asks how they can get more trees planted. Ani suggests that they email their local municipal office.
	While searching for the right person to contact, she comes across the Growing Shade website. Ani realizes she can use the mapping tool to make a strong
	case for her student's request.
	<br>
	<br>
	Since the school is a relatively small area, Ani wants to use a small geographical level. After looking at all the different boundaries, she decides that
	<b>block groups</b> are the best choice. Ani finds and clicks on the location of the school on the map and discovers that it is in tract 14.01, block group 2.
	</p>
	<br>
	<img class="center story" src="www/uc1_1.PNG">
	<img class="center story" src="www/uc1_2.PNG">
	<br>
	<p class="home">
	<br>
	Ani asks her class which of the four themes they want to use. She hovers over each theme and reads out the variables that each one includes.  
	The students decide that the <b>public health</b> theme is the best fit: it includes the percent of people under 18 and the amount of current tree canopy.
	Ani clicks on public health and the class immediately sees from the colors on the map that their block group is a high priority -- Ani hovers over the map 
	and confirms that the priority score is 8.5.
	</p>
	<br>
	<img class="center story" src="www/uc1_3.PNG">
	<br>
	<p class="home">
	<br>
	Ani scrolls down to the report to see how their block group scores for the other themes. It scores low for conservation, but high for the climate change and environmental justice themes.
	One of her students points out that amount of tree canopy in their block group is about half of the county average. 
	</p>
	<br>
	<img class="center story" src="www/uc1_4.PNG">
	<img class="center story" src="www/uc1_5.PNG">
	<br>
	<p class="home">
	The class agrees that there is a lot of evidence that more trees should be planted at their school! 
	Ani downloads the Growing Shade report so her class can include it in their email.
	<br>
	<br>
	<img class="center story" src="www/uc1_6.PNG">
	<br>
	<p class="home">
	Ani still isn't sure who to contact, so she emails the Tree Canopy Collaborative.
	A member of the Collaborative is able to connect her with an organization that gives away free trees.
	After reading the class's email and the Growing Shade report, they agree to plant trees at the school!

<div class="accordion">Town Planner</div>
<div class="panel">
	<br>
	<p class="home">
	Kai is the planner for a town located in Dane County. The town council is allocating money for next year's budget and asks Kai to present them with some data-driven options.
	Kai's department does not have the resources for local data collection, so Kai does a quick search for open datasets and finds out about Growing Shade.
	</p>

	They begin by selecting the 'cities and townships' geography and search for their town in the dropdown.
	<img class="center story" src="www/uc2_2.PNG">
	<img class="center story" src="www/uc2_3.PNG">
	<br>
	They try out all of the pre-made themes, but ultimately decide they want to consider as many variables as possible. 
	Kai clicks on the 'Custom' option and selects all of the variables in each category.
	<br>
	<img class="center story" src="www/uc2_4.PNG">
	<img class="center story" src="www/uc2_5.PNG">
	<br>
	They scroll down to the report and compare their town to the county averages. Kai notices that the '% acres in a primary flood zone' variable is much higher than the county average.
	They also see that the '% of residents who own their home' is significanty lower. All the other variables are close to or better than the county average. 
	<br>
	<img class="center story" src="www/uc2_6.PNG">
	<br>
	<img class="center story" src="www/uc2_8.PNG">
	<br>
	Kai concludes that flood mitigation and affordable housing should be priorities in the new budget. Kai downloads the raw data
	so that they can easily make custom graphs to include in their presentation to the town council.

<div class="accordion">Community Organizer</div>
<div class="panel">
	<br>
	<p class="home">
	Mateo runs a community organization operating out of the City of Madison. He is applying for a grant to purchase sensors that residents can use
	to monitor the air quality in their neighborhoods. Residents from two different neighborhoods have spoken to him about experiencing poor air quality -- Mateo
	plans to combine their stories with data in his grant application.
	</p>
	<br>
	<img class="center story story-stretch" src="www/uc3_1.jpg"><p style="text-align:center;">Image credit: John Diez (Pexels)</p></img>
	<br>
	<p class="home">
	Mateo has heard about Growing Shade from his collegues and decides to try it out. He uses the 'neighborhoods' geography. The grant funds projects centering
	on environmental justice, so Mateo selects that theme. Although the colors on the map show prioritization by block group, the boundary lines for neighborhoods
	let Mateo quickly assess that neighborhoods he's focusing on are a high priority. He turns on the 'historically redlined areas' layer and notices that one
	of the neighborhoods has a large area that was redlined. Mateo clicks the 'full screen' button and takes a screenshot image of the map to include in the grant application.
	</p>
	<br>

	<br>
    <img class="center story" src="www/uc3_2.PNG">
	<br>
	<p class="home">
	Next, Mateo wants to find data supporting resident's experiences of poor air quality. He creates a custom theme that includes several variables from the 'Health' category.
	He also decides to add in the '% of tree canopy', since trees are known to improve air quality. His custom theme confirms that the same two neighborhoods remain high priorities.
	Mateo selects one of the neighborhoods in the drop-down menu and reads through the custom report. He notices that the neighborhood is in a block group with a low amount of tree canopy compared
	to the county average.
	</p>
	<br>
	<img class="center story" src="www/uc3_5.PNG">
	<br>
	<p class="home">
	Mateo decides to expand the scope of his grant application. He adds a new request for funds to start a tree planting project that will improve the local air quality. 
	He sees from the 'land use' section of the report that there are opportunities to expand canopy in residential and right-of-way areas.
	Mateo proposes a campaign to provide free trees to residents and to lobby the local government to plant more trees next to roads and sidewalks.
