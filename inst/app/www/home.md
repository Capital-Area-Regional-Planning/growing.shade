<a href="https://daneclimateaction.org/Initiatives/Tree-Canopy#ImportanceofCanopy">benefits that trees provide</a>. 
Enhancing and preserving tree canopy cover is an important step to creating a healthy and resilient county. </p>
<br>
<p class="home"> 
Growing Shade was developed for residents, community groups, planners, and foresters. 
Stakeholder engagement remains essential to understanding community-specific concerns and opportunities for enhancing, preserving, and maintaining the tree canopy. 
Growing Shade combines demographic, environmental, public health, and socioeconomic data. 
Here are a few ways you can use the mapping tool. </p>

<h2><b>Trees Are Part of the Solution</b></h2>
<p class="home">
Trees are uniquely suited to addressing biodiversity and public health challenges as well as a host of community benefits. 
But trees are only part of a larger solution. In addition to urban tree canopy, we need a variety of native ecosystems that also provide similar 
air quality, biodiversity, and health benefits in tandem with tree planting and maintenance. 
Only through a whole-system approach can we assess what the biggest needs are in a community and what solutions are most appropriate at different sites.
</p>
<br>
<p class="home">
You can learn more about the benefits of native plants and gardens as well as receive access to native plants through the 
<a href="https://www.ripple-effects.com/Plant-Dane"> Ripple Effects program</a>.

<h2><b> Who can use Growing Shade? </b></h2> 
<p class="home">
Click the panels below to read about a few different use cases. 
</p>

<div class="accordion center">Teacher</div>
<div class="panel">
	<br>
	<p class="home">
	Ani teaches the third grade. As part of an environmental unit, she sends her students outside to see how many different kinds of trees they can find. 
	Unfortunately, her class discovers that there are only a few trees surrounding their school.
	</p>
	<br>

	<br>
	<br>
	<p class="home">
	Her class asks how they can get more trees planted. Ani suggests that they email their local municipal office.
	While searching for the right person to contact, she comes across the Growing Shade website. Ani realizes she can use the mapping tool to make a strong
	case for her student's request.
	<br>
	<br>
	Since the school is a relatively small area, Ani wants to use a small geographical level. After looking at all the different boundaries, she decides that
	<b>block groups</b> are the best choice. Ani finds and clicks on the location of the school on the map and discovers that it is in tract 14.01, block group 2.
	</p>
	<br>
	<img class="center story" src="www/uc1_1.PNG">
	<img class="center story" src="www/uc1_2.PNG">
	<br>
	<p class="home">
	<br>
	Ani asks her class which of the four preset themes they want to use. She hovers over each theme and reads out the variables that each one includes.  
	The students decide that the <b>Canopy Cover</b> theme is the best fit, as it shows the amount of current tree canopy.
	Ani clicks on Canopy Cover and the class immediately sees from the colors on the map that their block group is a priority area.
	</p>
	<br>
	<img class="center story" src="www/uc1_3.PNG">
	<br>
	<p class="home">
	<br>
	Ani scrolls down to the report to see how their block group scores for the other themes. 
	The class is excited to see that it's a priority area for every theme!
	One of her students also points out that amount of tree canopy in their block group is about half of the county average. 
	</p>
	<br>
	<img class="center story" src="www/uc1_4.PNG">
	<img class="center story" src="www/uc1_5.PNG">
	<br>
	<p class="home">
	The class agrees that there is a lot of evidence that more trees should be planted at their school! 
	Ani downloads the Growing Shade report so her class can include it in their email.
	<br>
	<br>
	<img class="center story" src="www/uc1_6.PNG">
	<br>
	<p class="home">
	Ani still isn't sure who to contact, so she emails the Tree Canopy Collaborative.
	A member of the Collaborative is able to connect her with an organization that gives away free trees.
	After reading the class's email and the Growing Shade report, they agree to plant trees at the school!

<div class="accordion">Town Planner</div>
<div class="panel">
	<br>
	<p class="home">
	Kai is the planner for a town located in Dane County. The town council is allocating money for next year's budget and asks Kai to present them with some data-driven options.
	Kai's department does not have the resources for local data collection, so Kai does a quick search for open datasets and finds out about Growing Shade.
	</p>

	They begin by selecting the 'cities and townships' geography and search for their town in the dropdown.
	<img class="center story" src="www/uc2_2.PNG">
	<img class="center story" src="www/uc2_3.PNG">
	<br>
	They try out all of the pre-made themes, but ultimately decide they want to consider as many variables as possible. 
	Kai clicks on the 'Custom' option and selects all of the variables in each category.
	<br>
	<img class="center story" src="www/uc2_4.PNG">
	<img class="center story" src="www/uc2_5.PNG">
	<br>
	They scroll down to the report and compare their town to the county averages. Kai notices that the summer temperature is almost 5 degrees higher than the county average.
	They also see that the '% of residents who own their home' is significantly lower. All the other variables are close to or better than the county average. 
	<br>
	<img class="center story" src="www/uc2_6.PNG">
	<br>
	<img class="center story" src="www/uc2_8.PNG">
	<br>
	Kai concludes that heat relief and affordable housing should be priorities in the new budget. Kai downloads the raw data
	so that they can easily make custom graphs to include in their presentation to the town council.

	<p class="home">
	Mateo runs a community organization operating out of the City of Madison. He is applying for a grant to purchase sensors that residents can use
	to monitor the air quality in their neighborhoods. Residents from two different neighborhoods have spoken to him about experiencing poor air quality -- Mateo
	plans to combine their stories with data in his grant application.

	<br>
	<p class="home">
	Mateo has heard about Growing Shade from his colleagues and decides to try it out. He uses the 'neighborhoods' geography. The grant funds projects centering
	on environmental justice, so Mateo begins by selecting the Socioeconomic Indicators theme.
    Mateo wants to find data supporting resident experiences of poor air quality, so he also selects the Health Disparities theme.
	<br>
	<br>
	Although the colors on the map show priority areas by block group, the boundary lines for neighborhoods
	let Mateo quickly assess whether the neighborhoods he's focusing on are a high priority for one or both themes.
	He also turns on the 'historically redlined areas' layer since the historical context is relevant to his proposal.
	Mateo clicks the 'full screen' button and takes a screenshot image of the map to include in the grant application.
