**Q. How are the priority block groups determined?**
<span style="line-height: .1;"><br></span> A. Priority block groups are
determined using a number of variables for each theme. For each variable, a block group 
receives a score based on how its value compares to the distribution of all values for the variable. 
The total score for a block group is the sum of the scores of each variable included in the theme. 
If the total score is equal to or higher than the threshold for the theme, 
the block group is considered a priority area. 

More information is given in the “methods” tab.

**Q. How did you choose the variables for the priority layers?**
<span style="line-height: .1;"><br></span> A. Presets are developed to
provide starting points for various stakeholder groups.

**Q. How can I isolate individual variables? Can I visualize the
patterns for a single variable?**
<span style="line-height: .1;"><br></span> A. Click on the “Custom”
priority layer, then select a single variable.

**Q. I’m interested in understanding how the tree canopy intersects with
a specific racial or ethnic group rather than all communities of
color.** <span style="line-height: .1;"><br></span> A. Raw data can be
downloaded from within the “mapping tool” tab if you wish explore
relationships not shown in the report.

**Q. Why do different canopy tools show different priority areas?**
<span style="line-height: .1;"><br></span> A. There are several tools,
like the
<a href = "https://www.americanforests.org/our-work/tree-equity-score/" target = "_blank">American
Forests’ Tree Equity Score</a>, that are worth exploring. The Growing
Shade Project was created to specifically address the unique challenges
and opportunities of our region, reflecting priorities that may not be
so readily detailed in a national, more generalized tool. In Growing Shade,
priority areas are determined only using data from Dane County, letting
us understand how canopy is distributed in our region, as opposed to comparing canopy on a state-wide or national level. 
Additionally, users can customize our tool to address their individualized needs, 
which can be highly specific (for instance, a user may want to focus on planting
trees in areas to enhance health benefits in children).


**Q. Why do different canopy tools show different canopy coverage
percents?** 
<span style="line-height: .1;"><br></span> A. We created this tool to
respond to the stakeholder need of providing up-to-date, actionable
data. Therefore, we focus on satellite data to provide current data that
can be used in decision-making. Current data is necessary to manage
impacts from invasive species like emerald ash borer or respond to
emerging climate hazards.

To get current (near real-time) data, Growing Shade leverages Sentinel-2
satellite data. While Sentinel-2 data has excellent temporal resolution,
the spatial resolution is 10 meters squared. This is often a bigger area
than the canopy from a single tree.

For the original Twin Cities region tool, detected tree canopy from Sentinel-2 data 
was compared with a more spatially accurate (but less temporally accurate)
<a href = "https://gisdata.mn.gov/dataset/base-landcover-twincities" target = "_blank">1
meter squared landcover data set</a>. There was high correlation but
Sentinel-2 data detected about a quarter more tree canopy than the 1 meter
squared landcover data. Essentially, this means that for the Twin Cities region, 
the methods in Growing Shade detect areas with at least 89% tree canopy coverage. We
re-scaled our data using this relationship to improve the clarity of
messaging -- we hope to perform a similar analysis for Dane County in the near future
to improve the accuracy of reported canopy.
More information is given in the “methods” tab.


**Q. Is it possible to get the type of information Growing Shade
provides for other areas? Is it possible to get historic data about the
tree canopy from Growing Shade?**
<span style="line-height: .1;"><br></span> A. Right now the focus of
Growing Shade is on current conditions within Dane County. 
We do have future updates and new features of this tool planned,
but cannot ensure that any updates will meet specific needs. Please look
to the “resources” tab to see if another product might meet your needs,
and thank you for your interest and understanding.
