Planting shade looks differently across the region. Here are some
stories and ideas to better contextualize this work and to inspire
imagination at what the future could look like.

### Region-wide

-   **Logging**: Over the last 200 years, our region has experienced
    profound land cover changes. Commercial logging in Minnesota began
    in 1839 with the founding of a sawmill in Marine on St. Croix. This
    created a legacy of reduced tree cover which still persists today.

    a video about logging in Stillwater</a>.
-   **Invasive species**: Spread of invasive species like the Emerald
    Ash borer (invasive insect) or Dutch elm disease (invasive pathogen)
    threaten trees and the benefits they provide. Costing millions of
    dollars to manage with results that often fail to save trees, such
    invasive species have left the region with new canopy gaps. Read a

    of how Dutch elm devastated trees in Minneapolis and St. Paul</a>.
-   **Extreme weather**: Extreme weather events like tornadoes and
    straight line winds are natural occurrences in our region, although
    climate change can intensify their severity. Trees are susceptible
    to damage by these storms, and re-vegetation after weather events
    has been a challenge faced

    North Minneapolis</a> as well as other communities in our region.

-   **Provide food or timber**: Several inspiring projects to provide
    tree-based food or timber are making the Twin Cities region
    healthier and more sustainable. Read about greening local artist
