**Climate change:** Trees can mitigate some consequences of climate
change by cooling land surface temperatures and reducing flooding. Use
this preset to identify areas most at risk from climate change.<br><br>

**Environmental justice:** The natural and built environments intersect
with income, race, and ethnicity. This preset identifies areas and
people facing disproportionately negative consequences of environmental
decisions.<br><br>

**Public health:** Trees improve air quality and cool land surface
temperatures which can lead to better health outcomes, particularly for
sensitive populations. Use this preset to identify areas where trees
could most improve health outcomes.<br><br>

**Custom:** Select this option to customize the prioritization
variables.<br><br></span>
