<span align="left"> Presets are developed to provide starting points for
various stakeholder groups. Priority scores are calculated using
equally-weighted variables. <br><br>

**Climate change:** Trees can mitigate some consequences of climate
change by cooling land surface temperatures and reducing flooding. Use
this preset to identify areas most at risk from climate change.<br><br>

**Environmental justice:** The natural and built environments intersect
with income, race, and ethnicity. This preset identifies areas and
people facing disproportionately negative consequences of environmental
decisions.<br><br>

**Public health:** Trees improve air quality and cool land surface
temperatures leading to better health outcomes, particularly for
sensitive populations. Identify areas where trees could most improve
health outcomes.<br><br>

**Conservation:** Above and beyond enhancing the tree canopy, reducing
tree canopy loss will be critical to meet carbon emission reduction
goals and conserve biodiversity across taxa. This preset identifies
areas with the regionâ€™s highest stock of existing trees. <br><br>

**Custom:** Select this option to customize the prioritization
variables.<br><br></span>
