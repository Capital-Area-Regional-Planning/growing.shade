<h2><b> Who We Are </b></h2>
<br>
<p class = "home">
	When we know better, we do better. 
	That’s the ethic of the Tree Canopy Collaborative (TCC), a network of governmental, nonprofit, and academic partners jointly invested in preserving and expanding urban tree canopy across Dane County. 
	In the past, the benefits of urban tree canopy were not well understood, nor were their public health or economic value considered tangible benefits. 
	The effects of socioeconomic segregation that segregated cities along racial lines meant that the lack of urban tree canopy paralleled these policies. 
	As a result, underserved populations today are likely to have less tree canopy than affluent neighborhoods across the United States.
	<br>
	<br>
	We can do better. The Tree Canopy Collaborative’s mission is to preserve, maintain, and expand urban tree canopy across Dane County, with an emphasis on underserved areas. 
	This means taking action to plant trees where gaps exist while maintaining those that we already have. 
	We also aim to increase the county’s understanding of the vital role trees have, especially as it relates to building resilient communities in the face of increasing climate threats.
	<br>
	<br>
	For example, did you know that urban trees can reduce the effects of extreme heat that climate change is bringing? 
	Shade reduces surface temperatures and cools the air, providing immediate benefits to the neighborhood. Trees also mitigate the effects of flooding, which is predicted to continue to increase in southern Wisconsin with climate change.

<h2><b> Approach </b></h2>
<br>
<p class = "home">
	Just as important as the goal is the approach. Community initiatives need to be led by <i> members of the community </i> if they are going to directly address local needs. 
	We believe that engaging communities to co-develop tree-related priorities and solutions is essential to avoiding harm and ensuring that residents have the agency to determine how their community should look. 
	We understand that residents have the best understanding of their own neighborhoods; our role is to facilitate community-driven solutions that account for hyper-local factors 
	that influence where and which trees belong (or don’t belong!), and that the community may have other needs beyond just planting trees.
	<br>
	<br>
	As a result, TCC partners directly with community organizations and residents to receive input on where trees should be located, and then helps organize planting events with our donated trees. 
	Resident volunteers and local arborists come together for a planting event and then the TCC works with community organizations and the municipality to ensure ongoing maintenance and watering is continually managed.
	<br>
	<br>
	Through hosting these events we noticed effects beyond the trees themselves. 
	Children leave the event curious and inspired about trees, and adults feel a renewed sense of pride in their community. 
	Moreover, everyone feels a little more ownership over “their” trees and neighborhood, which we hope translates beyond the trees themselves.</p>
<br>
<h2><b> Join Us! </b></h2>
<br>
<p class = "home">
	Our goal is to provide assistance to neighborhoods and cities that are interested in filling urban tree canopy gaps on city streets, public parks, and private residences. 
	And because the TCC has an abundance of arboriculture and community engagement expertise, we can provide input in partnership with residents to ensure a well thought out plan for how trees can benefit an area and where they can be placed to maximize that value. 
	In addition, we can provide donated trees, help organize tree planting events, and provide education on how to plant and maintain those trees.
	<br>
	<br>
	But our job is just beginning. 
	Our group has only been in existence since 2021 and we are continually looking for new community groups and partners. 
	If you are a community group interested in working with the TCC in your neighborhood, let’s talk!
