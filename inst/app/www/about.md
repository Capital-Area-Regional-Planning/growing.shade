<h2><b> Who We Are </b></h2>
<br>
<p class = "home">
	<a href="https://tree-canopy-collaborative-carpc.hub.arcgis.com/">The Tree Canopy Collaborative </a> is a network of governmental, academic, nonprofit, private, and community organizations invested in tree canopy and climate resilience. 
	We bring together organizations and people working on all aspects of canopy, in every part of Dane County.
	<br>
	<br>
	In the past, the benefits of urban tree canopy were not well understood, nor were their public health or economic value considered tangible benefits. 
	The effects of socioeconomic segregation that segregated cities along racial lines meant that the lack of urban tree canopy paralleled these policies. 
	As a result, underserved populations today are likely to have less tree canopy than affluent neighborhoods across the United States.
	<br>
	<br>
	We can do better. The Tree Canopy Collaborative supports preservation, maintenance, and expansion of tree canopy across Dane County, with an emphasis on underserved areas. 
	We maintain a network for resource and knowledge sharing, identify opportunities for regional collaboration, and provide canopy tools, maps, and analysis.
