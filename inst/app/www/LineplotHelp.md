#### Variation in tree canopy

<section style="font-size: 12pt; text-align: left">
This plot shows the distribution of the tree canopy across the regionâ€™s
704 Census tracts. The selected tract, or tracts which make up a
selected city or neighborhood are highlighted in green.

On the top is a density plot. The more occurrences of a value, the
taller this plot gets. The density plot is showing that most Census
tracts have a tree canopy coverage of 20-35%.

On the bottom is a box plot, where each grey circle shows the tree cover
in one Census tract. The line in the middle of the box shows the median
value: half of the tracts fall below the median, and half of them lie
above the median. The median is also known as the 50th percentile. The
top and bottom edges of the box show the 75th percentile (the value
below which 75% of the geographic areas fall) and the 25th percentile
(the value below which 25% of the geographic areas fall). Tracts located
above and below the vertical lines extending from the box are
particularly extreme values.
