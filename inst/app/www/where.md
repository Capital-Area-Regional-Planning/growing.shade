<!-- <br> -->

There are many dimensions that can and should be considered when
deciding where to plant trees. <br>

-   **Existing tree cover**: knowing which areas have relatively low
    tree cover versus areas that have relatively high tree cover can
    help direct tree planting efforts.
-   **Equity**: communities of color and other marginalized groups
    disproportionately live in areas which lack tree cover and/or have
    high negative externalities which could be mitigated in part by tree
    cover (air pollution, etc.)
-   **Existing land use**: information about land use can help direct
    messaging and outreach (ie if opportunities exist for planting trees
    within residential area, the messaging will look very different than
    if the greatest opportunities for planting trees lies within
    commercial zoned areas)
-   Other: …

<!-- Similarly, there are multiple things to consider in making a useful tool: -->
<!-- - **Understandable**: clear and actionable conclusions need to be drawn from complex and disparate data sources. Conclusions should be understandable to the general public (given that tree planting fundamentally impacts people and neighborhoods), to practitioners (to make informed decisions about planting trees), and to subject matter experts (to facilitate the iterative nature of this work and ensure the tool incorporates the best available research). -->
<!-- - **Narrative**: planting trees today will change the trajectory of a neighborhood's canopy for the future. Incorporating stories needs to be part of the tool... -->
<!-- - **Research-based**: this tool should incorporate relevant research and be transparent in our methods. This tool should be designed flexibly so that new research and new data sources can improve the conclusions (especially around climate resiliency/adaptation), spatial accuracy (down to 1m in accuracy would be the gold standard), and geographic spread (expanding from the Twin Cities region to statewide and beyond) of this tool. -->
<!-- - **Interactive**: knowing that different funding programs and/or local priorities will dictate on-the-ground action (of planting trees), this tool should allow for users to set their own prioritization scheme if they so desire. -->

<br> This tool aggregates data to help facilitate discussions around
enhancing our region’s tree canopy in order to improve climate
resilience, livability, economic opportunity, and beauty. See the
Methods tab for more information. **Note, the detailed ‘priority zones’
is based off of “greenspace” work right now. It will be updated to
better reflect tree canopy detail before the technical meeting on June
28 - thanks for your patience!**

<!-- Select variables of interest at the left and update map to view results. Warm and bright (yellow, orange) values and high ranks correspond to ‘opportunity zones’ where new tree plantings could have disproportionately positive impacts (values closer to 10). Cool and dark colors (black, purple) correspond to lower opportunity areas (values closer to zero). Click on any tract to get more information. -->

<!-- There is the capability to plot the human dimensions at the Census block group level (finer resolution than tracts, which are shown here). The data pieces are not yet aggregated in that way, however. As this is just a proof-of-concept idea, so I figured it didn't matter. All the data pieces are weighted equally, but we could weight them differently too. This is just my take on this and would need much more work/input/etc. if we wish to continue down this avenue..... -->

<!-- ### Methods -->
<!-- Pulling together: -->
<!-- - "Greenness" (normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from Sentinel-2, peak NDVI in 2020 aggregated to the block group level and also at 10x10m resolution) -->
<!-- - Equity considerations data -->
<!-- - Existing land use -->
