Managing the tree canopy is a complex and important subject. Growing
Shade is a unique tool offering users the ability to customize
prioritization and see detailed maps of tree canopy gaps. It is under
active development, so please check back or contact us for more details.
However there are other external resources tools which may be useful,
and it should be noted that there are still many unanswered questions.
The list below has been compiled as a starting point.

<br> Additionally, our experience and research tells us that data cannot
substitute for engagement with prioritized stakeholders to understand
community-specific concerns or opportunities. The on-the-ground
knowledge of residents and the expertise of practitioners are valuable
sources of information necessary to enhance and refine the shared
understanding of this data.
